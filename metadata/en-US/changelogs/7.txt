Bug fix and feature release.

- Fixed a bug where showing the status bar wouldn't persist.
- Fixed a bug where some items in the context menu of an application were bigger than others.
- Fixed scaling of the About page in the preferences.
- Created a custom preference for selecting launcher setting values as ListPreference detects touches weirdly with many items.
- Set specific colors for editing text (cursor, highlight, text color) in the search and renaming fields so that there is always enough contrast.
- Added the ability to choose any application for the clock and date shortcuts.
- Added an option to reset all launcher settings.
- Moved general UI options into a separate fragment.
